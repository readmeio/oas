/**
 * As of when this test was written our JSON Schema generation deduped schema enums with
 * `[...new Set(['1', '2'])]`. Problem is that with our current TS config (at the time) that the
 * TS-compiled code  wouldn't be able to convert the Set to an array, resulting in that line
 * returning an empty array. Though we've since fixed this by changing that line to use
 * `Array.from()` instead of the spread operator this bug ended up making its way into production
 * and wiped all cases of enum values, leaving empty dropdown selectors for all of our customers
 * for roughly 18 hours.
 *
