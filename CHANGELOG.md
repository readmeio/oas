## 17.0.0 (2021-11-05)

> **BREAKING CHANGE**
>
> As part of our ongoing project to rewrite the tooling side of this library to Typescript we've changed the core `Oas` class to no longer store its OpenAPI definition on itself as part of `this`. If you need access to data from the API definition you've supplied it, you should use `this.api` now.

* ci: cleaning up the codeql workflow ([53c4a07](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/commit/53c4a07))
* fix: refactoring away `global.d.ts` because it's not compiled to the dist ([030a4b3](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/commit/030a4b3))
* feat: migrating more of the library to typescript (#532) ([59e8144](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/commit/59e8144)), closes [#532](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/issues/532)
* refactor: changing how the Oas class internally stores its API definition (#536) ([76b2406](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/commit/76b2406)), closes [#536](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/issues/536)

## 16.0.0 (2021-10-28)

> **BREAKING CHANGE**
>
> This library no longer ships with a browser-targeted dist. If you need to the tooling side of this library within a browser you'll need to handle bundling with your favorite tool for doing so.

* fix: removing webpack and a browser-targeted export (#529) ([a4e84c8](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/commit/a4e84c8)), closes [#529](https://github.com/readmeio/oas/issues/529)



## 15.0.0 (2021-10-28)

> **BREAKING CHANGE**
>
> Lots of changes here!
>
> - We're starting a slow process to transition the library to Typescript so a couple sub-libraries here now have exposed Typescript declaration files.
> - The `flattenArray` and `flattenSchema` exports have been removed.
> - The primary entrypoint for the library has been moved from `src/` to `dist/` so if we don't export something you're using you'll likely have a tough time to access it. If you need something let us know and we'll add an export for it (we're also open to PR's!).
>
> We're also starting to adopt OpenAPI 3.1 and have access a heap of new accessors in the `Oas` and `Operation` classes as well as extending support for it immediately to the `oas validate` CLI command. ðŸ¥³
